SYNC | SPOTIFY API, REACT, DJANGO, MySQL, Redis, AWS, Git 

This is a re-upload of one of the project I created with a team of 7 in 2021.
One of the my first big Full-stack web application which I contributed a lot to.
This taught me how to work on a full-stack web application as a member of a big team.

Role: Back-end dev. 
Conceptualized and proposed the project idea, effectively persuading the team to adopt it. Played a crucial role in all aspects of project development.

Key-concepts that make this project a perfect candidate as a final/senior project:
- Implemented APIs from a well-known product, Spotify, to develop a new feature: live-streaming and sharing music with friends/participants. (This feature was later introduced by Spotify and Discord in their apps in 2021.)
- Sufficiently complex to engage a team of seven developers.
- Community based + Scalable.
- Capable of simultaneous interaction with multiple users.
- Utilized a range of cutting-edge technologies including AWS, Spotify API, React, Django, MySQL, Redis, and Git.

Description:
SYNC | SPOTIFY API, REACT, DJANGO, MySQL, Redis, AWS, Git 

Collaborated with a team of seven to design and develop a versatile platform that replicates the concert experience at home. The website allows users to listen to music together in real time and interact with each other.
• Developed APIs using Python and created the frontend with components from React frameworks, including Ant Design.
• Integrated the Spotify API to provide a personalized listening experience and implemented a real-time chat and voting system through customized listening rooms.
• Utilized Redis for chat data storage and deployed the application on AWS.

## NO code needs to be stored in the root of your repository. You may rename the application folder if you like to your team's application name. But all source code related to your team's application should be stored inside the application folder.
