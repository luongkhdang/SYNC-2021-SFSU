This is a re-upload of one of the project I created with a team of 7 in 2021.
One of the my first big Full-stack web application which I contributed a lot to.
This taught me how to work on a full-stack web application as a member of a big team.

Description:
SYNC | SPOTIFY API, REACT, DJANGO, MySQL, Redis, AWS, Git 

Collaborated in a team of 7 to design and develop a multi-purpose platform that mimic the concert experience at
home. This website let users listen to music together in real time, and interact with others.
• Wrote the APIs in python and built the frontend using components from React frameworks like Ant Design.
• Structured the product to use Spotify API and implemented a real time chat and voting system by creating
personalized listening rooms.
• Used Redis to store the chat data and deployed the application on AWS.
